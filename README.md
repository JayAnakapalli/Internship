During my internship, I focused on virtualization and malware analysis, where I developed and managed virtual machines to simulate real-world environments for testing and analysis. I performed in-depth malware analysis using tools like Cuckoo Sandbox and VirusTotal to understand malicious software behavior. I also utilized the MITRE ATT&CK framework to detect and respond to cybersecurity threats, enhancing the overall security and response strategies. This experience allowed me to strengthen my technical skills in cybersecurity, threat detection, and virtualization.
